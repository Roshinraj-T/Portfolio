Hi, my name is Kelvin, and I am a full-stack developer. Although I am relatively new to the field, I have gained a lot of experience during my 9-month internship at CTS, where I worked with a team of experienced professionals. During my time there, I learned a lot about developing software applications and collaborating with team members to achieve project goals.

Aside from my passion for software development, I am also an avid volleyball player. I enjoy playing the sport and have been a member of several teams over the years. I have even had the opportunity to lead some of these teams and have developed excellent leadership skills in the process.

One of the things I enjoy most about my work is the opportunity to solve complex problems. As a developer, I am constantly challenged to come up with creative solutions to problems and this is something I find very fulfilling. I enjoy working with other team members to brainstorm ideas and find the best solutions to complex problems.

Overall, I am a motivated and dedicated individual who is passionate about technology and problem-solving. I am excited to continue growing as a full-stack developer and look forward to making valuable contributions to the field.
